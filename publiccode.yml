    shortDescription: "Fleet tracking system"
    longDescription: >
          VVFGeoFleet is a system allowing to track a fleet,
		  where vehicles are equipped with GPS enabled
		  devices periodically sending their position. The
		  system is composed of two main modules: (i) a backend
		  module, based on a RESTful server; (ii) a frontend
		  module, based on an Angular GUI.

    documentation: "https://github.com/vvfosprojects/vvfgeofleet"
    featureList:
       - Message interpolation (keep-alive messages about steady
	     vehicles are suppressed and summarized by the following
		 messages, to save space of storage);
       - Too high velocity warnings (warning notification in
	     case of too fast vehicles);
       - Online statistics (real-time computed statistics giving
	     the taste of how the system is performing);
	   - IP-based authorization (to prevent unauthorized source
	     sending position messages).
