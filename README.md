# VVFGeoFleet
VVFGeoFleet is a system allowing to track a fleet, where vehicles are equipped with GPS enabled devices periodically sending their position.

The system is composed of two main modules:

* a backend module, based on a RESTful server;
* a frontend module, based on an Angular GUI.

## The backend
The backend is written in C# Asp.Net WebApi, using Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition, with a persistence layer based on MongoDB document database.

The backend:
* collects position messages coming from GPS enabled devices installed on board the vehicles;
* publishes REST actions to efficiently query the collected data.

Queries allow, for instance, to:
* getting the current fleet position (also by vehicle class);
* getting a vehicle position;
* getting a vehicle tracked path, within a given time interval;
* getting vehicles near to a given point (also by vehicle class);
* getting vehicles within a given rectangle;
* getting vehicles inactive since too much time.

The backend is optimized to collect data and hold them forever, without the need for purging old data periodically. The RESTful API leverages the MongoDB database and its spatial features. All database queries are carefully optimized to exploit indexes; thus, the response time is extremely low even in case of millions messages stored.

The RESTful API enables the frontend to graphically display data, but it is especially conceived to be queried by other applications (B2B) in order to act as a decision support system (DSS).

## The frontend
The frontend is based on Angular4 and uses Google maps javascript API to show information.

_To be completed_

# Note
Currently the source code and the RESTful interface is a mix of English and Italian words. During the implementation, the Italian words will be translated as much as possible.

# Side features

## Messages interpolation

VVFGeoFleet can receive keep-alive messages (e.g. every minute or so) from vehicles, in order to promptly know whether a vehicle is out-of-field or the GPS device is faulty. In presence of many vehicles (i.e. more than 10.000) those messages might be heavy to be stored.

To cope with this issue, VVFGeoFleet holds only messages carrying position deltas, while interpolating messages received by the same vehicle in the same position. Interpolation information is saved together with the interpolating messages, so to prevent such inforation to get lost.

## Too high velocity warnings

On each position message reception, VVFGeoFleet computes the vehicle velocity comparing the received message with the latest stored one. In case such velocity exceeds a given threshold, a warning is traced in the application log (based on log4net). Too high velocities might be due to bad GPS device configuration of faulty GPS device.

## Online statistics

System publishes statistics about message arrival per day, total number of stored messages, messages arrival rate, etc. Statistics can be read to check correct system operation, and can be processed through automated systems in order to raise alarms in case of anomalous indicators.

## IP-based authorization

Posting position messages can be subject to client authorization, based on IP source address. The web.config allows to enable/disable IP-based authorization through a flag and to specify the list of allowed IP and/or networks (e.g. 127.0.0.1, 8.8.8.8, 10.0.0.0/24, 172.16.0.0/16).

## Push notifications to clients

The server exposes a web socket the clients can subscribe to, in order to receive new vehicle positions, as they arrive, via push notifications.

# API Documentation

## POST /api/messaggiPosizione

###### Complexity: `O(log Nv)` Nv being the total number of vehicles.

Stores a new position message. Position message payloads are structured as follows.


```json
{
    "codiceMezzo": "APS.12345",
    "classiMezzo": [ "APS", "benzina" ],
    "localizzazione": {
        "lat": 14.2345,
        "lon": 43.4321
    },
    "istanteAcquisizione": "2017-11-27T10:12:00.1234Z",
    "fonte": {
        "codiceFonte": "AH222",
        "classeFonte": "gpsTracker"
    },
    "infoFonte": {
    
    }
}
```
It returns the stored message location, together with the message itself.

## GET /api/messaggiPosizione/{id}

###### Complexity: `O(log Nm)` Nm being the number of stored messages.

Returns the message with the specified `id`.

## GET /api/posizioneByCodiceMezzo/{vehicleCode}

###### Complexity: `O(log Nv)` Nv being the total number of vehicles.

Returns current position for the specified vehicle code (translated as `codiceMezzo` in the code).

Note: should vehicle code contain a dot (.) character, you have to add a trailing slash (/) to the action call. Otherwise you would end up having a 404 error.

## GET /api/posizioneFlotta?attSec={seconds}

###### Complexity: `O(Nv)` Nv being the total number of vehicles.

Returns current position of the entire fleet.

Only the updated positions are returned, i.e. those arrived since the last `attSec` seconds. `attSec` parameter is optional and defaults to the value contained in the `Web.Config` file (`orizzonteTemporale_sec` parameter).

## GET /api/posizioneFlotta/perClassi?classiMezzo={class1}&classiMezzo={class2}&attSec={secondi}

###### Complexity: `O(Nv)` Nv being the total number of vehicles.

Returns current position of the entire fleet, just for the vehicle classes specified as  input parameters.

Only the updated positions are returned, i.e. those arrived since the last `attSec` seconds. `attSec` parameter is optional and defaults to the value contained in the `Web.Config` file.

## GET /api/prossimita?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&distanzaMaxMt={distMt}&classiMezzo={class1}&classiMezzo={class2}&attSec={secondi}

###### Complexity: `O(Nv)` Nv being the total number of vehicles.

Returns vehicles close to the specified point, within the maximum radius specified as input parameter (`distanzaMaxMt`).

Optionally, it is possible to specify an array of vehicle classes as a filter.

Only the updated positions are returned, i.e. those arrived since the last `attSec` seconds. `attSec` parameter is optional and defaults to the value contained in the `Web.Config` file. The distance from the specified center is returned, too.

The result is structured as follows.
